title: 15 years!
---

15 years passed since we embarked on a journey to build something we can own. To
prevent ourselves having to work under someone else. To be truly free:
financially free.

As I look back, it has been a wild ride. Many down turns and pitfalls were there
along the path but I throughly enjoyed it. I know we haven't quite reached where
we set out to reach but I can see signs of reaching there in a few years.

But if there is one thing I would like to tell my stupid young self, it is this:
life is more about luck than anything else. You can call it god's will or luck,
but thats the key. Our efforts just improve our odds, but its luck that makes or
breaks the game. So don't sweat too hard, there too many variables we can't
touch.

> The journey is more important than the destination.

We have started a journey of 1000 miles, unsure whether we will live long enough
to see the destination. So its far more important to love the path. It
can't be forced but this awareness can be acquired.
