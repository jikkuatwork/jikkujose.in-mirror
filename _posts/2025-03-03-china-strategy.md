title: "China’s Robotics Gambit"
excerpt: "Open-sourcing to own the game"
---

China’s [open-sourcing of robotics][osrobotics] tech, like the Tiangong
humanoid, isn’t charity—it’s a calculated power play. By
sharing tech, they aim to lead the global robotics
revolution, leveraging their manufacturing might. History
shows this works.

## Why It Works

- **Scale Advantage**: Even with the know-how there is no competition.
- **Ecosystem Lock-in**: Free tech seeds global reliance,
  tying innovation to China’s orbit.
- **Standard Setter**: Can define robotics norms.

## Historical Playbook

Example              | Move                  | Payoff
-------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------
[Prestige][ttk]  | Freed gasket tech     | Saved industry by fixing pressure cooker explosions
[GPS][gps]           | Opened signal         | Became the global standard, fueled trade
[Volvo][volvo]       | Freed seat belt tech         | Earned safety icon status, free since ’59
[Android][android]   | Open-sourced OS       | Built a mobile empire, now ruling 70% of phones
[Tesla][tesla]       | Freed EV designs      | Crowned EV market king by fueling a boom they lead

## China’s Endgame

Open-sourcing robotics isn’t giving up control—it’s
claiming it. Like TTK saved cookers or Tesla sparked EVs,
China’s Tiangong sets the stage. They’ll build the future
while others tinker with their blueprints.

History proves it: share the tech, own the game.
