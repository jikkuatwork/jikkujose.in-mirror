GPG symmetric encryption - universal fallback that's always there. Perfect for long-term cold storage and air-gapped setups.

## Base Command
```bash
gpg --symmetric file
```

## Hardened Version
```bash
gpg --symmetric \
    --cipher-algo AES256 \
    --s2k-digest-algo SHA512 \
    --s2k-count 65011712 \
    --s2k-mode 3 \
    file
```

All params embedded in file. Future decryption just needs vanilla GPG.

## Symmetric vs Asymmetric Security
- Symmetric: single point of failure (password) vs multiple (private key, config files, keyring)
- No key management complexity
- No web of trust/keyserver issues
- No risk of key revocation problems
- No forward secrecy concerns
- Easier to rotate (just re-encrypt)
- Simpler to verify security properties
- Quantum resistant (AES-256)
- Easier air-gap procedures
- No metadata about recipients
- No risk of GPG version compatibility with key formats

## Parameter Reasoning
- AES256: Post-quantum resistant (Grover's = ~2^128 operations)
- SHA512: Better suited for modern 64-bit systems than SHA256
- s2k-count 65011712: Higher iteration count = stronger key derivation
- s2k-mode 3: Salted + iterated mode, prevents rainbow tables

## Quantum Resistance
- Symmetric AES256: Quantum resistant (Grover's algorithm only halves security)
- Good for long-term storage even in post-quantum era
- Only applies to symmetric mode - asymmetric GPG not quantum safe
- NIST approved for post-quantum standards

## Keys & Memory
- Password length > 20 chars minimum
- GPG wipes temp memory after use
- Uses kernel memory locking when available
- Memory dumps during decryption won't leak full key
- Memory wiping works even after crash/panic

## Air-Gapped Usage
```bash
# On networked system
gpg --symmetric --output secrets.gpg secrets.txt

# Transfer to air-gapped via USB

# On air-gapped (any live distro)
gpg --decrypt secrets.gpg
```

Works on any live distro - GPG comes standard. No config or setup needed. Perfect for:
- Air-gapped cold storage
- Dead drop file transfer
- Offline key storage
- Cross-system secrets

Note: Always check gpg binary hash on untrusted systems.

## Why it works

- Zero deps
- No config needed
- Params in file
- Part of GNU coreutils
- Universal availability

Explicit parameters > editing configs. Keep systems vanilla.
