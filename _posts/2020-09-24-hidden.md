title: GPG Hidden Recipient
---

GPG leaks public key info with encrypted files. Depending on the use case this
could be a security threat.

Following command reveals the recipient's public key from the
`encrypted_file.gpg`.

```
gpg --pinentry-mode cancel --list-packets encrypted_file.gpg
```

This can be prevented by using `-R` or `--hidden-recipient` flag instead of
`-r` or `--recipient` flag while encrypting.

So, instead of encrypting files as follows by leaking recipient information:

```
gpg --encrypt --recipient elon@tesla.com
```

We can use the following to keep Elon annoymous from such a threat.

```
gpg --encrypt --hidden-recipient elon@tesla.com
```
