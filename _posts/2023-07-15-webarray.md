Abstractions that fit our minds like jigsaws are fun to play with. While
building tools, I have often felt state management at the backend is needlessly
complicated especially for very small tasks. Say, a list management or a counter
or even a simple email form.

It's not about the difficulty, but these complicated database setups can drain
the joy from building an idea in just a few hours. Especially with ChatGPT, we
can now give life to an idea that we have been thinking about in practically no
time. So, I wanted to build a tool that speeds up managing small states a
breeze.

> A web store with granular access control. Free. Anonymous. Available
> everywhere.

## Ruby Demo

![Ruby Demo](/assets/ruby-demo.svg)

## Quick Start

Open a browser console & follow along:

#### Import library

``` js
import("https://cdn.toolbomber.com/js/WebArray.min.js")
```

#### Generate keys

``` js
const keys = await WebArray.generateKeys("USE_YOUR_SEED")
```

#### Create instance by passing keys

``` js
const wa = new WebArray(keys)
```

Note: You can skip any of the `read`, `append` or `replace` keys to restrict
the instance from doing the corresponding action.

#### Append

``` js
await wa.append("Mango")
```

#### Read

``` js
console.log(await wa.read())
```

#### Replace

``` js
await wa.replace('Bye!')
```

## Features

- It can do `read()`, `append(item)` & `replace(item)`
- Access can be restricted by removing the specific keys in `webArray.keys`

## Use cases

- Forms
- Email Collectors
- Chat Systems
- Polls
- Surveys
- Feedback Collectors
- Leaderboards
- Status pages

## Apps

- [Parayu](https://parayu.toolbomber.com)

## Examples

### Shortest Backendless Code

Full frontend and backend app in 11 lines of readable code!

Edit it live in [CodePen](https://codepen.io/jikkuatwork/pen/GRwBzBY?editors=1000)

``` html
<script src="https://cdn.toolbomber.com/js/WebArray.min.js"></script>
<script type="module">
  const fruits = await WebArray.create("fruits")
  document.querySelector("table").innerHTML += (await fruits.read())
    .map(f => `<tr><td>${f.name}</td><td>${f.updatedAt}</td></tr>`)
    .join("")
</script>

<table>
  <tr><th>Fruit</th><th>Unix Time</th></tr>
</table>
```

## Access Control

WebArray instances requires the `read`, `append` or `replace` keys to do the
specific actions. To prevent a specific action, initialize WebArray using the
keys object excluding the corresponding access key.

Try creating the keys locally, save the seed and use the specific keys required
in the page.

### WebArray.generateKeys(seed)

For instance `keys` can be independently created and used to initialise the client for
fine grained access control.

``` js
const keys = await WebArray.generateKeys("YOUR_UNIQUE_KEY")

delete keys.append
delete keys.replace

const readOnlyClient = new WebArray(keys)
```

## Design Goal

I hope WebArray will be used by folks to test ideas on the fly. It certainly
won't scale, but thats not the point. The trade-off here is rapid prototyping,
as WebArray eliminates 90% of the overhead in setting up a data store, allowing
you to get your idea off the ground in just a few hours.

## ChatGPT + WebArray = ðŸ’¥

Checkout how a [single prompt](https://www.phind.com/search?cache=fm9pd7xylg959zsvqb3rbb3x) can generate a fully functional [todo app](/apps/todo/) with zero edits.

## Note

- All remote access functions are `async`, do remember to use `await`
- A seed can hold a maximum of 800KB of data.
- Anyone with the **seed** can read/modify the data; use keys to protect data
- Not intended to be used for anything critical or even in production
- Planning to open source the code in future
- Regardless of what is used to replace it, WebArray will always return an array.
