Abstractions that fit our minds like jigsaws are fun to play with. While
building tools, I have often felt state management at the backend is needlessly
complicated especially for very small tasks. Say, a list management or a counter
or even a simple email form.

Its not about difficulty but these complicated DB setups sucks out the joy in
building an idea in a few hours. Especially with ChatGPT, we can now give life
to an idea that we have been thinking about in practically no time. So, I wanted
to build a tool that speeds up managing small states a breeze.

WeArray is a web service to manage small states. Its free, annonymous, available
for web, Ruby, Python and Node.

I will use Ruby for the examples (trust it would be very readable).
