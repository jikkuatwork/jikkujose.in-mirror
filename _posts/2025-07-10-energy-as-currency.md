title: Energy as Universal Currency

## The Scope and Scale

Everything is energy. Not in the mystical sense, but as a fundamental unit of
account that transcends traditional boundaries between physics, biology,
economics, and governance. From subatomic particles to galactic systems, from
cellular metabolism to national economies, energy flows drive all processes.

This perspective proposes energy as the universal currency - the common
denominator that allows us to compare and analyze systems across vastly
different scales and domains. A star's collapse, a predator-prey cycle, a
city's metabolism, a startup's burn rate - all become comparable when viewed
through energy accounting.

The scale is truly universal. We can analyze:

- Quantum systems and their energy states
- Biological organisms and their metabolic requirements
- Human societies and their energy consumption patterns
- Economic systems and their resource allocation
- Political structures and their operational overhead
- Technological systems and their energy conversion efficiency

## Bitcoin: The Digital Proof of Concept

Bitcoin represents perhaps the most elegant implementation of this concept in
modern times. It directly converts energy expenditure into monetary value
through proof-of-work, making energy the literal foundation of currency
creation.

Unlike fiat currencies backed by political promises or gold backed by scarcity,
Bitcoin is backed by thermodynamic reality. Each bitcoin represents a
verifiable amount of energy that was irreversibly converted from available
electricity into computational work. This creates a direct link between
physical energy and economic value.

The Bitcoin network's energy consumption isn't a bug - it's the feature that
makes it work. The energy expenditure creates security, decentralization, and
trust without requiring traditional institutions. It's energy converted into
monetary infrastructure.

## Historical Context and Precedents

This isn't an entirely new idea. Ecological economist Howard Odum developed
"emergy" (embodied energy) analysis in the 1970s, quantifying ecosystems and
economies in energy units. Odum's work demonstrated that energy accounting
could reveal patterns invisible to traditional economic analysis.

The concept also echoes earlier proposals for energy-based currencies and
accounting systems. What's different now is the computational power to actually
implement such systems and the global perspective that makes universal energy
accounting practically relevant.

## Significant Caveats and Limitations

This mental model comes with important limitations that must be acknowledged:

**Information and Complexity Loss**: A microprocessor and a heater consuming
identical wattage create vastly different value. Pure energy accounting misses
the information content, organization, and emergent properties that create
value beyond raw energy conversion.

**Quality Differences**: High-grade electricity differs fundamentally from
low-grade heat, even at equivalent joules. The model treats all energy as
equivalent when thermodynamic availability varies dramatically.

**Human Preferences**: Cultural values, aesthetics, meaning, and status drive
significant economic activity through mechanisms that aren't directly energy-
based. Art, entertainment, and social interactions create value that energy
accounting poorly captures.

**Service Economy Gaps**: Knowledge work, financial services, and information
processing don't map cleanly to energy consumption patterns. A brilliant
insight might consume minimal energy but create enormous value.

**Coordination Overhead**: The model may underestimate the energy costs of
coordination, communication, and organizational overhead that enable complex
systems to function.

## Why This Mental Model Matters

Despite these limitations, energy-first thinking provides crucial advantages
for systems analysis:

**Universal Comparability**: Energy accounting allows direct comparison across
completely different domains. How does a city's energy efficiency compare to
a biological organism's? How does political system overhead compare across
different governance structures?

**Constraint Identification**: Every system has energy throughput limits.
Energy accounting quickly identifies bottlenecks and physical limits before
detailed analysis. It reveals the hard boundaries within which all optimization
must occur.

**Speed of Analysis**: You can ballpark-evaluate any system in minutes rather
than months. Is this organization's energy burn sustainable? Which development
path maximizes energy efficiency? What are the energy implications of this
policy?

**Scale Transitions**: The model predicts inflection points where systems must
restructure or collapse due to energy constraints. It reveals when coordination
costs exceed energy benefits.

**Crisis Prediction**: When energy flows get disrupted, the model shows cascade
effects faster than complex economic models. Energy shocks propagate through
systems in predictable ways.

## The Fundamental Trade-off

This mental model embodies a classic trade-off: accuracy versus speed. By
reducing everything to energy terms, we lose nuance and detail. We miss the
subtle interactions, cultural factors, and emergent properties that make
systems complex and interesting.

But we gain something valuable: the ability to quickly assess systems across
any scale or domain. We can make strategic decisions based on fundamental
constraints rather than getting lost in local optimizations.

The model works best for:

- Strategic planning and high-level decision making
- Cross-domain comparisons and analogies
- Identifying fundamental limits and bottlenecks
- Understanding system-level patterns and relationships

It works poorly for:

- Fine-grained optimization within systems
- Cultural and social analysis
- Information-intensive activities
- Creative and artistic evaluation

## Conclusion

Energy as universal currency isn't meant to replace detailed analysis - it's
meant to inform it. Before diving into complexity, this mental model helps
identify what's worth analyzing in detail. It provides a reality check based
on thermodynamic principles that no amount of financial engineering or
political maneuvering can circumvent.

In a world of increasing complexity and interconnection, sometimes the most
valuable tool is the simplest one that works across all scales. Energy
accounting provides that tool - a rough but reliable compass for navigating
systems of any size or type.

The goal isn't perfect accuracy. The goal is useful insight, quickly obtained,
that helps us make better decisions about how to organize human activity within
the constraints of physical reality.
