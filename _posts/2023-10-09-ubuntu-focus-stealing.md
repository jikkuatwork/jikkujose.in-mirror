title: Ubuntu Focus Stealing Bug
---

Ubuntu's 22.04 version has sadly been giving some annoying bugs recently.

So, I thought of jotting this down to prevent me from having to hunt again for
the solution.

## Issue

Focus gets lost when workspace is switched.

## Solution

Disable the 'Desktop Icons NG' extension in the Extensions app
