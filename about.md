I am a tech entrepreneur. I love philosophy and strategy. I often think about
nature of reality, game theory, simulation hypothesis, AGI and meaning of life.

I love breaking down concepts into simple visualisable analogies. Many of them
are contrived but some of them have worked well.

I believe tech & great policies can wipe away most of our problems. People
dieing of hunger, trivial illness and conflicts shouldn't be happening today.
Strong political will and policy design with clever use of tech could have
solved these problems yesterday.

I also fancy simplicity of design and aesthetics. Minimal, functional designs
give me joy. I have very low tolerance for bloated, ill thought designs,
architecture, furnture and tools.

Speaking of tools, I think tool use is a great measure of intelligence. The
better leverage an entity could acquire is a direct feeler of their applied
intelligence. I see engineering as a process of tool design within constraints.

I am passionate about the tools I use. And I am very concious of the tools I use.
I am guilty of spending considerable amount of time fine tuning my setup
(chair/table) to devices and the apps I use (especially my beloved text editor:
neovim).

Though, Mr. Lincoln's time split seems to be bit too much. I tend to relate to
the quote. Fine tuned tools perform much better, putting us in flow longer.

I [tweet](https://twitter.com/jikkujose) quite often and I am planning to take
up blogging. Lets see how this goes.
