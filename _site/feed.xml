<p>As I look back, it has been a wild ride. Many down turns and pitfalls were there
along the path but I throughly enjoyed it. I know we haven’t quite reached where
we set out to reach but I can see signs of reaching there in a few years.</p>

<p>But if there is one thing I would like to tell my stupid young self, it is this:
life is more about luck than anything else. You can call it god’s will or luck,
but thats the key. Our efforts just improve our odds, but its luck that makes or
breaks the game. So don’t sweat too hard, there too many variables we can’t
touch.</p>

  <p>The journey is more important than the destination.</p>

<p>We have started a journey of 1000 miles, unsure whether we will live long enough
to see the destination. So its far more important to love the path. It
can’t be forced but this awareness can be acquired.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[15 years passed since we embarked on a journey to build something we can own.

<p>The need I had is very simple: I needed a setting/flag to open Vim/Neovim in
private mode. This was so that the cirtical files I opened left no traces to be
recovered by a malicious program. I wanted the editor to open without any
plugins, swapfiles, or backup so that it exited without a trace when its closed.
Not even ability for the process to connect to Internet.</p>

<p>I wanted this to be a temporary setup for critical files alone. This can be
acheived by explictly disabling <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">swapfile</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">backup</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">undofile</code>. It turns
out that Vim/Neovim can accept commands via flags. Now, in addition to these I
also wanted Vim to not load any plugins. Beyond the complexity that gets
introduced via plugins, there is a real security aspect in today’s plugins as a
bunch of them can &amp; do send the contents of the file to external server. For
example TabNine &amp; Github Copilot.</p>

<p>I have packed all these settings into an alias that can easily invoke a private
session of Neovim:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">alias np='unshare -rn nvim --clean -n -c "set nobackup noswapfile noundofile"'</code></p>

<p>In addition to privacy, I am loving the speed of startup. Its makes one think,
how much the plugins affect the startup time. Perhaps I need to review my vimrc
and prune somethings to improve the speed. But thats for another post.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently one of my specific Vim need had surprisingly no simple enough solution.]]></summary></entry></feed>
