title: "Stateless Predictors to AGI"
excerpt: "Can self emerge from swarms of stateless intelligences"
---

Today's generative AI models—often fundamentally stateless next-token
predictors—are extremely powerful, but they lack continuity or genuine
memory. Every invocation is ephemeral, leaving no lasting state. But what if
we could extend their capability beyond single invocations into continuous,
persistent systems? Could genuine emergent intelligence or even AGI arise
from such approaches?

I recently explored an intriguing architectural idea on this topic, something
we referred to as *"Bat"*—a lightweight, recursive, container-based GPT
engine designed explicitly to achieve persistent states and long-term
continuity.

## Stateless Predictors—Limited Yet Powerful
The key limitation of current models (GPT-4 and similar APIs) is stateless
operation. Each API call is independent, with no inherent memory or long-term
continuity. As powerful as these models are, their ability to evolve
persistent intelligence or AGI is fundamentally restricted.

But if persistence can be externalized and carefully managed, perhaps these
limitations become irrelevant.

## The "Bat" Concept—From Statelessness to Persistence
We developed a compelling idea around containerization and recursive GPT
invocations, called "Bat." Bat embodies persistence externally—storing
context and memory intelligently, compactly, and persistently between stateless
model invocations. By recursively calling GPT instances, Bat essentially
chains multiple separate interactions into a coherent, persistent intelligence
across many invocations.

What starts as a containerized, recursive assistant could scale further:
multiple containers, or even a swarm—or *Bat Colony*—might coordinate
states, spawning parallel instances, collaborative workflows, and collective
memory management. A system like this has the potential to exhibit emergent
intelligence from recursive interactions among stateless GPT sessions, held
together by externally stored and well-managed persistent memory.

## Emergent Intelligence from a Bat Colony
Could genuine intelligence or AGI arise simply from these persistent recursive
interactions? Perhaps. Emergence occurs when complexity and interaction
surpass a certain threshold. A Bat Colony—multiple Bat instances
collaborating via shared memory—could become the foundation of something
more intelligent and continuous, transcending the limitations of purely
stateless GPT invocations.

## The Vision: Community-Driven Emergent AI
An exciting opportunity arises when considering multiple human participants,
each deploying their own containers and collaborating around shared goals,
tasks, and contexts. A distributed community would collectively host, manage,
and interact with this persistent AI entity—effectively creating and evolving
intelligence at scale, collectively steering forward a shared emergent mind.

However, with these exciting foundations come several critical concerns and
questions.

## Four Key Considerations for Persistent, Emergent AI

### 1. Preventing False Memories
Persistent intelligence requires accurate, reliable memory. But externalized
summaries risk drifting or introducing inaccuracies. Important questions arise:
- How do we guarantee stored contexts accurately represent previous sessions?
- Could verification or cryptographic signing ensure long-term fidelity?

### 2. Managing Distributed State
Distributed Bat Colonies introduce increased complexity in state management.
Successful management means coordinated, reliable consensus around the shared
state.
- How should we synchronize states efficiently and avoid conflicts?
- Could we develop decentralized ledger-inspired methods for managing state?

### 3. Preventing Malicious Actors
If communities host distributed AI system. Mixed Model Invocation Strategies
Finally, relying solely on one model class limits adaptability. Could using
heterogeneous models (GPT-4 for planning, specialized lightweight models for
summarization or anomaly detection, etc.) enhance resilience and flexibility?
- What architectures best support multiple, specialized model invocations?
- Can adaptive routing strategies automatically select optimal models
  dynamically?

## Future Exploration
These questions push at the frontier of what we know: iterative development and
careful experimentation will undoubtedly reveal new solutions, patterns, and
challenges along the way.

From simple stateless next-token predictors to a community-hosted, distributed,
persistent emergent AI—what started as a modest container design ("Bat") holds
potential implications far larger and more exciting than initially expected.

In future discussions, we'll explore each consideration deeply, refining the
architecture, security, and model-integration strategies needed to responsibly
shape what could become genuine, emergent artificial general intelligence.

Stay tuned!
