title: Decentralized AI Inference Marketplace on ICP
---

## Project Overview

The Decentralized AI Inference Marketplace aims to create an open platform
where anyone can contribute compute resources for AI inference, with the
economic and governance infrastructure built on the Internet Computer
Protocol (ICP). This marketplace will democratize access to AI capabilities,
reduce costs, and enable a truly decentralized AI ecosystem.

## Problem Statement

AI inference currently faces three critical challenges:

1. **Centralization**: Major cloud providers control AI compute
   infrastructure, leading to high costs and potential censorship

2. **Resource Inefficiency**: GPU resources are underutilized globally,
   while demand for AI inference grows exponentially

3. **Economic Barriers**: High costs limit accessibility for developers
   and creators, especially in emerging economies

## Solution: Decentralized AI Marketplace

Our marketplace enables anyone to:

- **Provide compute resources** through a simple onboarding process
- **Request AI inference** via standardized APIs
- **Earn rewards** for contributing resources
- **Use AI capabilities** at competitive prices
